Trunk-based development -> merging to one branch (trunk) and building from it
  - merge when feature is complete


Git flow                         - release/1.2.x
                                /
  - develop ----------------------------------
   \                          /         /
    - feature/new-feature-1 -       2 -


 - featurebranch -> deploy&test locally
 - develop -> deploy to dev
 - master/main -> deploy to test
 # at this point "release" should be prepared
 - releasebranch -> deploy stage/pre-prod (with tags!) & test
                \
                 \ -- validate migration process (rejects usually expected)
                  \
                    - (if everything OK) deploy the same to prod

Git branch policies (e.g. push to master only using PR, min 2 approvers, build succeeds)


Ephemeral envs - short-lived (minutes to months) -> testing of feature branches, PR build checks

PR build checks:
  - syntax validity
  - memory leaks
  - unit testing
  - e2e testing
